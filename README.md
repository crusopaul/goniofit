# About goniofit
''goniofit.p'' is a python script that allows the user to analyze the data in xrdml files created by the PANalytical X'Pert Pro MRD XL, specifically used to curve fit peaks in goniometer scans. Goniofit might also work with other XRD machines that create xrdml files. goniofit was created to help me with my [senior capstone project](https://sites.google.com/maine.edu/paulcarusocapstone). Numpy, Scipy, and Matplotlib are used to smooth the data, perform curve fits, and graph the results. This script will display fit parameters as well as output an RMSE value for the fit.
